    <h3>I am a Web Devoloper </h3>
    <p>I'm a full-stack developer with a tendency to back-end.
        I prefer to stay up to date with the whole development process from database structure and server infrastructure to mobile responsive views and analytics.
        Moreover, I dive deep into company business processes and I won't hesitate to suggest any ideas aimed to improve it from the development side.
        
        I like to follow the GitLab workflow with stable at any point in time master branch and separate feature branches, delivering updates immediately without risk for production code.
        For all projects I use Docker and Docker Compose.
        I use Django Rest Framework for all issues related to API creation thankful to its flexibility and robust structure.
        Task scheduling related problems I solve with Celery and Redis as a message broker.
        I stick to standard React.js stack with Redux and Saga and forms processing with either Redux Form or Formik.
        I'm excited to find a way to integrate with third-party services going beyond provided API, often using great Python tools as Scrapy, Beautiful Soup and pure Regular Expressions.</p>
